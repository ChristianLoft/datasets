Here and there where heaviness of character development and Story arch should have been present it was lacking. Other than that this movie is out of this world.

137,"Brave Concepts","Dear shills and Villenuvians, I am sorry to disturb you but the Dune 1984 trailer BY ITSELF has more logic, structure, film making sense and ""magic"" than the entire 156 minutes of Villainuff\'s Dune. (2021) Just the phrase ""he who controls the spice, controls the universe"" sums it up. Just the warning of the Guild navigator to the Emperor sums it up. Even Fayd Rautha\'s menace sums it up. (Of course these are all missing in Villainuff\'s Dune) David Lynch had to cram the whole story into 1 SINGLE MOVIE... a 137 minute film... where Villainuff couldn\'t even bother to explain the basic setting, mayor players and background in 156 minutes of HALF of his version. Villeneuve DOES NOT CARE about Dune. He cares about photography and scenic landscapes. Villeneuve sells IMAX CANDY. He DOES NOT care about immersing a new audience into Dune\'s story. Villeneuve isn\'t worth the choam on his cappuccino. His version is worth an IMAX ticket but nothing will linger in your mind. It\'s a PG13 THEME PARK RIDE.

175,"Dzengiz Tafa","To put it this way (spoiler free)... Allthough Dune (part one) tried to tell an epic story with beautiful visuals and an interesting music score it yields a very boring result without stakes and no character development. You would expect that in a 2 and a half hour movie that serves as a prologue at least the story is laid out and ends with a climax to keep you interested for part two. Sad to say that the movie doesn\'t even build up to a climax and ends like ""whut? This is it?"". There is no character development at all which renders an impact of a scene or death of a character emotionless. You couldn\'t care less about what happens. The movie drags on with long dragging scenes that are supported by its epic score. The stakes however are immensly lacking. A scene or event in movies normally lead to repercussions and ripple effects that add meaning to certain scenes. The severe lack of any meaningfullness and impact of key story events throughout left me wondering what else I could have done with my 2 and a half hours.

Allthough Dune (part one) tried to tell an epic story with beautiful visuals and an interesting music score it yields a very boring result without stakes and no character development. You would expect that in a 2 and a half hour movie that serves as a prologue at least the story is laid out and ends with a climax to keep you interested for part two. Sad to say that the movie doesn\'t even build up to a climax and ends like ""whut? This is it?"". There is no character development at all which renders an impact of a scene or death of a character emotionless. You couldn\'t care less about what happens. The movie drags on with long dragging scenes that are supported by its epic score. The stakes however are immensly lacking.

From my point of view I am assured that this movie will be the next ""cinematic Event"" similiar to Lord of the Rings AND it will satisfy hardcore Dune-Fans (like me) too. As a matter of fact I don¬¥t mind the ""muscle or smile"" joke, because its a nice Character-Moment and shows (as described in the books) Pauls slim shape. Thats a good way to adress this topic and shows in a second the relationship between charakters. Looking at the director, the cast, the acting, the music, the coloring, the cinematography or what I have seen in the delivered material, what I have heard from people whom have seen approx. 20 Minutes I feel save and respected (as a Dune-Fan). They are doing an outstanding job. This will be groundbreaking in every asspect (and will set the tone and scale for upcoming movies).

From my point of view I am assured that this movie will be the next ""cinematic Event"" similiar to Lord of the Rings AND it will satisfy hardcore Dune-Fans (like me) too. As a matter of fact I don¬¥t mind the ""muscle or smile"" joke, because its a nice Character-Moment and shows (as described in the books) Pauls slim shape. Thats a good way to adress this topic and shows in a second the relationship between charakters. Looking at the director, the cast, the acting, the music, the coloring, the cinematography or what I have seen in the delivered material, what I have heard from people whom have seen approx. 20 Minutes I feel save and respected (as a Dune-Fan). They are doing an outstanding job. This will be groundbreaking in every asspect (and will set the tone and scale for upcoming movies).

Frank Herbert didn\'t do quippy dialogue. Still don\'t see what\'s so impressive about this Zendaya chick that she dominates the first third of the trailer. As weird as the personal shields were in the Lynch version, these are worse. And I have new appreciation for Kyle McLachlan\'s Paul Atreides given this new one. But then, we\'re only seeing the first half of the book, so maybe his performance ticks upward when he becomes Usul. Still don\'t know if splitting the book was ballsy or stupid. Are they seriously waiting on the performance of the first half before making the second? They should have filmed both halves, but just broken up the release, a la The Matrix Reloaded  Revolutions, or the original plan for the 1978 Superman movies.

My answer is always, and will be, Read-The-Damn-Book! You will be able to appreciate more how extraordinary is the work of Frank Herbert; but, in addition, you can fully appreciate how excellent a filmmaker Denis Villeneuve is. Dune is a difficult book to adapt, Lynch suffered it firsthand. But Denis is a superb filmmaker, who has already tried, more than once, how to adapt a difficult or impossible work. Remember ""Arrival""? Try to read ""Story of your life"" by Ted Chiang and you will see how hard is to bring from there a movie so extraordinary as ""Arrival"" is; then you understand why Denis is the perfect filmmaker for Dune. I have read the book, Herbert\'s book series (there are six), about 7 times, since I was a teenager, even before Star Wars appeared in the Hollywood firmament. Dune is, in scope and dimension, far superior to all Star Wars ever. Philosophy, ecology, notions about power, governance, imperialism, social issues, leadership and religion, all that and more is in Herbert\'s work. Dune\'s first two books describe Paul\'s journey, from his rising to his crashing downfall. It is a philosophical lesson written in the late 50s, and published in 1965, long before all the big budget series and films that Hollywood has us used to. Star Wars was inspired by Dune and Foundation, but it definitely gravitated to Asimov\'s slight science fiction trend, not Herbert\'s hardcore science fiction, but it owes him in themes and even in geographic details, power structures and even in characters. Dune is the real canonical masterpiece of hardcore science fiction. Period! And Villeneuve is the only director today who can do Herbert justice. And I can guarantee you that, as far as I have been seeing to this day, he is doing him justice.","UgyDfwRjpU9qtdVwWbR4AaABAg","",0,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g18jFHCLXk&ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures&lc=UgyDfwRjpU9qtdVwWbR4AaABAg","2021-07-25 19:51:07",0,"I do not know how many reviews or reactions I have seen where people express their doubts about whether or not to read the original source, or see the old and disastrous David Lynch film first.

Although Ms. Wang was released two days later, Mr. Yang was held in Xuanhua Detention Center. The police submitted Mr. Yang‚Äôs case to the procuratorate in April 2020. When his lawyer called prosecutor Cheng Xing on May 7 to inquire about his case, Cheng said that he was planning to indict Mr. Yang and submit his case to the court in two or three days. On September 4, 2020, Mr. Yang was tried in the Xuanhua District Court. He entered a not guilty plea and demanded that the judge play the DVDs confiscated from him. He said he didn‚Äôt violate the law in having Falun Gong informational materials. Mr. Yang‚Äôs daughter also defended him in court. She said, ‚ÄúI have to say something when my father is being treated unjustly.‚Äù She shared how Falun Gong changed her father for the better and brought happiness to her family. She also said that in today\'s society with rapidly declining morality, her father has always taught her to be a kind and upright person. The hearing started at 9:15 a.m. The judge adjourned for a ten-minute break at 11 a.m. When the judge adjourned it a second time around 1:30 p.m., the prosecutor left suddenly without a giving reason, so the judge had to end the hearing. The judge sentenced Mr. Yang to eight years with a 10,000-yuan fine on March 16, 2021. He appealed with the Zhangjiakou City Intermediate Court, which upheld his original sentence on July 19, without having a hearing. He was taken to prison on the same day.","UgyQmDBh62xAaZM-jWN4AaABAg","",0,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g18jFHCLXk&ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures&lc=UgyQmDBh62xAaZM-jWN4AaABAg","2021-07-25 01:09:45",0,"Arrest and Sentencing Mr. Yang and his wife Ms. Wang Huijun were arrested on December 3, 2019, while talking to people about Falun Gong at a local market.

The 1984 version was ambitious but disappointing, and I\'ve always been sad for David Lynch, but as movie technology advanced, I\'d hope from time to time that someone would try it again. It appears now that Denis Villeneuve might have made the Dune of my imagination with a cast of A-list actors who look like they were made for their characters.

He was praising the actors and actresses in the movie. He was creating positive buzz for the upcoming film in a way that few other people could do. WB was getting the best form of advertising that exists. His extremely high praise will bring many people to the box office to see Dune when it opens. Why would someone from WB claim his video for copyright issues. Whoever at WB made this decision stabbed one of Dune\'s biggest fans in the back yesterday by claiming his video. If you do this sort of thing, you will alienate the fan base that is currently building in large part because of the positive buzz that YouTube creators are producing. Please do not destroy your fan base as it is building. I want to see Dune 2021 be very successful so that there can be more movies to tell more of the Dune sage. Warner Brothers can hurt this movie by alienating the fan base. Please do whatever you can to keep the most ardent Dune fans producing positive hype.

How do you genuinely show your love to someone? What is the greatest showing of love? The answer is sacrifice and then time. Christ Jesus paid the cost for us, through His sacrifice on the cross that we may live a life of health, deliverance and prosperity. What is it that you lose in spending time with Him, thanking Him for the privilege of seeing another day, and by reading His word ‚ÄúThe Bible‚Äù.......nothing. He offers you the gift of eternal life through having a relationship with Him, and partaking in this relationship immensely benefits you . He protects, guides, provides, heals, delivers, prospers, blesses you, and so much more. A true, authentic relationship involves communication on both sides. Christ Jesus is often taken for granted, many don‚Äôt give Him the slightest of acknowledgement, regardless He is still merciful and loving. Seek Him, acknowledge you‚Äôre a sinner, lost without Him and destined for destruction, REPENT, REPENT, REPENT, believe in your heart wholeheartedly what He did for you on that cross and His resurrection. Confess with your mouth that He is Lord, and you‚Äôve taken your first steps on that straight and narrow path to eternity in heaven with Him. And in this process your life will never remain the same, He will give you the Holy Spirit and grace, which will transform you and enable you to overcome sin, temptations and addiction and live a life that shows your love for Him. Slip ups happen, no one is perfect, but through asking for forgiveness and by His grace it will occur less and less. And you will enjoy pleasing Him and living a righteous life.

Momoa and Bautista are great ""bro"" superstars but the dopes who want to see wrestlers as movie stars aren\'t going to go see an arthouse boondoggle. Zendaya hasn\'t proven that she has star power on her own, and while Oscar Isaac is probably the most underappreciated actor of his generation, he\'s not going to put butts in seats either. If this clears $400 mil worldwide I\'ll be astounded. And if Part II isn\'t released direct to HBO Max, I\'ll be even MORE astounded.
