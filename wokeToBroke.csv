231,"Derick Hall","This is quite a pessimistic outlook. I do believe ESG should not be the primary metric. But I also think this video does not account for a ""profit at all cost"" mentality that a lot of companies and people have. What if services are inherently immoral or there are incentives, like a degrading society, that would drive people to deliver more socially conscious services? Perhaps a better view to pose against both ESG-only or profit at all cost is a holistic stakeholder focus which includes the triple bottom line, i.e. people, planet, profit. Working in a highly corporate and financial field I realise that as of today it is naive to think people do think this way. However, I do not think it is outside of the realm of belief that mainstream consumers and corporates will change their thinking around weighing ESG forces against profits. Overall, is it not irresponsible to bash ESG like this? To your point on oil, I totally agree, putting pressure on energy companies to become more ""green"" or shut down right away is perhaps illogical. Take our global dependance on coal as an example: Is coal bad for the environment? Yes. Do the vast majority of developing societies rely on coal? Yes. Here you see the E  S at odds. Now, am I naive to believe that these companies have a responsibility to at least either try to be more efficient or alternatively invest in greener technologies? Not saying current ""solutions"" e.g. wind is the solution, but are we not at a point as a global society where it seems logical to start looking for ways to find profit while taking ESG into account? I also thoroughly dislike the shoe example, that industry in particular has lead to a lot of grossly underpaid employees and shifting production away from underemployed countries for the sake of profit.

Because in those more affluent countries, there are laws that protect the welfare of the laborers, and the minimum wages are high. The reason companies are attracted to third-world countries like the country I live in is that there are less stringent ""ESG"" guidelines: mining companies can dump toxic wastes with impunity, the minimum wages here are cheap, which unfortunately is less than what is needed for decent living, workers live in cramped quarters, factories displace local wildlife and indigenous people, and so on. Government officials offer little to no resistance because they are bribed by companies. And resisting tribal chieftains are assassinated by bribed officials, to the benefit of the multinationals. In short, imposition of ESG on first-world countries is detrimental to companies, so they move to poorer countries that have low ESG standards, hence they profit, but at the expense of the local population.
